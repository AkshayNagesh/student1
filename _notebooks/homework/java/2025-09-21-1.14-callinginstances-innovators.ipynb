    "### Important Rules to Keep in Mind (AP Test-Specific):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You must create an object before calling its instance methods. You cannot call an instance method directly on the class name (e.g., ```Dog.bark()``` won't work unless bark is static).\n",
    "2. The object reference cannot be ```null```. If you try to call an instance method on a null reference, you'll get a ```NullPointerException``` at runtime.\n",
    "3. Arguments must match parameter types exactly (or be compatible through widening conversion). The number, order, and types of arguments must match the method signature.\n",
    "4. ```void``` methods don't return values. You cannot assign the result of a ```void``` method to a variable or use it in an expression (e.g., ```int x = d.bark()```; is invalid if ```bark``` is ```void```).\n",
    "5. Method calls are evaluated left-to-right. When chaining methods (e.g., ```obj.method1().method2()```), Java evaluates from left to right, and each method must return an appropriate object for the next call.\n",
    "6. Instance methods can call other instance methods of the same class directly (without needing ```this.```), and they implicitly operate on the same object.\n",
    "7. Parameter names in the method definition don't matter when calling. When you call ```c.add(5)```, the actual argument ```5``` gets passed to whatever the parameter is named in the method definition.\n"

    "## MC Hack Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1: **Answer - B**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **A** is incorrect because `deposit()` and `getBalance()` are instance methods, not static methods. You cannot call them directly on the class name `BankAccount`.\n",
    "- **B** is correct! It properly creates a BankAccount object, calls the instance method `deposit()` on it, and then calls `getBalance()` to retrieve the balance.\n",
    "- **C** is incorrect because `deposit()` is a `void` method - it doesn't return a value, so you can't assign it to a variable.\n",
    "- **D** is incorrect because `account` is declared but never initialized (no object created with `new`). Calling methods on an uninitialized reference causes a compile error.\n",
    "- **E** is incorrect because `getBalance()` requires an object to call it on, and `total` hasn't been initialized yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: **Answer - C (48)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "1. A Rectangle is created with length = 3 and width = 4\n",
    "2. `rect.scale(2)` multiplies both length and width by 2\n",
    "   - length becomes 3 * 2 = 6\n",
    "   - width becomes 4 * 2 = 8\n",
    "3. `rect.getArea()` returns length * width = 6 * 8 = **48**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: **Answer - B**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **A** is incorrect - `void` methods can be called without issue; they just don't return values.\n",
    "- **B** is correct! A `NullPointerException` occurs when you try to call an instance method on a reference that hasn't been initialized to point to an actual object (it's `null`).\n",
    "- **C** is incorrect - parameter/argument mismatches cause compile-time errors, not `NullPointerException`.\n",
    "- **D** is incorrect - instance methods can be called from outside the class as long as you have an object reference.\n",
    "- **E** is incorrect - this would cause a compile-time error, not a runtime `NullPointerException`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: **Answer - D**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **A** compiles fine - creates object and calls `getFahrenheit()` which returns a double.\n",
    "- **B** compiles fine - creates object and calls `setCelsius()` which is void.\n",
    "- **C** compiles fine - creates object, calls `getFahrenheit()` and stores result in a double.\n",
    "- **D** will NOT compile! `setCelsius()` is a `void` method (doesn't return anything), so you cannot assign its result to `int result`. This is a compile-time error.\n",
    "- **E** compiles fine - all valid method calls with appropriate types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5: **Answer - D**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **A** is incorrect - `pages` is a private variable, not accessible outside the Book class.\n",
    "- **B** is incorrect - even though `novel` is the object, you can't directly access private variables using dot notation (`novel.pages`).\n",
    "- **C** is incorrect - `getPages()` is an instance method, not a static method. You can't call it on the class name `Book`.\n",
    "- **D** is correct! `novel.getPages()` properly calls the instance method on the object, which returns the current value of pages (250 after adding 50 to the original 200).\n",
    "- **E** is incorrect - you need to specify which object to call `getPages()` on; just `getPages()` by itself won't work.\n"
