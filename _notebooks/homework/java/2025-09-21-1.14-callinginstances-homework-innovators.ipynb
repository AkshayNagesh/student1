    "## MC Hacks - Answers by Akshay\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1: **Answer - B**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **A** is incorrect because `deposit()` and `getBalance()` are instance methods, not static methods. You cannot call them directly on the class name `BankAccount`.\n",
    "- **B** is correct! It properly creates a BankAccount object, calls the instance method `deposit()` on it, and then calls `getBalance()` to retrieve the balance.\n",
    "- **C** is incorrect because `deposit()` is a `void` method - it doesn't return a value, so you can't assign it to a variable.\n",
    "- **D** is incorrect because `account` is declared but never initialized (no object created with `new`). Calling methods on an uninitialized reference causes a compile error.\n",
    "- **E** is incorrect because `getBalance()` requires an object to call it on, and `total` hasn't been initialized yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: **Answer - C (48)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "1. A Rectangle is created with length = 3 and width = 4\n",
    "2. `rect.scale(2)` multiplies both length and width by 2\n",
    "   - length becomes 3 * 2 = 6\n",
    "   - width becomes 4 * 2 = 8\n",
    "3. `rect.getArea()` returns length * width = 6 * 8 = **48**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: **Answer - B**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **A** is incorrect - `void` methods can be called without issue; they just don't return values.\n",
    "- **B** is correct! A `NullPointerException` occurs when you try to call an instance method on a reference that hasn't been initialized to point to an actual object (it's `null`).\n",
    "- **C** is incorrect - parameter/argument mismatches cause compile-time errors, not `NullPointerException`.\n",
    "- **D** is incorrect - instance methods can be called from outside the class as long as you have an object reference.\n",
    "- **E** is incorrect - this would cause a compile-time error, not a runtime `NullPointerException`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: **Answer - D**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **A** compiles fine - creates object and calls `getFahrenheit()` which returns a double.\n",
    "- **B** compiles fine - creates object and calls `setCelsius()` which is void.\n",
    "- **C** compiles fine - creates object, calls `getFahrenheit()` and stores result in a double.\n",
    "- **D** will NOT compile! `setCelsius()` is a `void` method (doesn't return anything), so you cannot assign its result to `int result`. This is a compile-time error.\n",
    "- **E** compiles fine - all valid method calls with appropriate types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5: **Answer - D**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **A** is incorrect - `pages` is a private variable, not accessible outside the Book class.\n",
    "- **B** is incorrect - even though `novel` is the object, you can't directly access private variables using dot notation (`novel.pages`).\n",
    "- **C** is incorrect - `getPages()` is an instance method, not a static method. You can't call it on the class name `Book`.\n",
    "- **D** is correct! `novel.getPages()` properly calls the instance method on the object, which returns the current value of pages (250 after adding 50 to the original 200).\n",
    "- **E** is incorrect - you need to specify which object to call `getPages()` on; just `getPages()` by itself won't work.\n"

    "| Criteria | Percent Weight | Self-Grade | Comments |\n",
    "|----------|---------------|------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Functionality** | 40% | 40/40 (100%) | ✅ Program runs without errors. Created 3 Student objects (Emma, James, Akshay) with different grades. Correctly adds grades using `addGrade()` method. Accurately calculates averages with proper decimal handling using `(double)` casting. Letter grades are assigned correctly based on the grading scale (A: 90-100, B: 80-89, etc.). All methods work independently for each student object. |\n",
    "| **Method Implementation** | 30% | 30/30 (100%) | ✅ All required methods are implemented: `addGrade(int points)` - void method that adds grades and increments counter. `getAverage()` - returns double with proper calculation. `getLetterGrade()` - returns String based on average. `printReport()` - void method with formatted output. All methods properly access and modify instance variables. Constructor initializes name and sets totalPoints/numAssignments to 0. Added bonus `getName()` getter method. |\n",
    "| **Code Quality** | 20% | 20/20 (100%) | ✅ Clean, well-organized code with meaningful variable names (totalPoints, numAssignments). Proper constructor implementation. Comprehensive JavaDoc comments explaining each method's purpose and parameters. Used proper encapsulation with private instance variables. Included error handling for division by zero in `getAverage()`. Added helpful status messages in `printReport()` based on letter grade. |\n",
    "| **Output & Presentation** | 10% | 10/10 (100%) | ✅ Clear, well-formatted output matching the sample format. Shows 3 students with different grades demonstrating independence. Formatted reports include all required information (name, total points, assignments, average, letter grade). Used `System.out.printf()` for proper decimal formatting (2 decimal places). Added extra features like status messages and a final summary table. Output is easy to read with proper spacing and separators. |\n",

    "4. **Proper OOP Principles**: Used private instance variables with proper encapsulation, implemented all required methods correctly, and demonstrated proper constructor usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Clean Output**: The output is well-formatted, easy to read, and matches the sample format while adding helpful extra information.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Points:** 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you'll demonstrate your understanding of instance methods by creating a `Student` class that tracks grades and calculates statistics. You'll practice creating student objects, adding grades, calculating averages, and generating grade reports—all using instance methods that operate on each student's individual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "Your program must include:\n",
    "- A `Student` class with at least 3 instance variables (name, total points, number of assignments)\n",
    "- A constructor that initializes the student's name and sets initial values\n",
    "- At least 2 void instance methods that modify the student's grades (`addGrade`, `printReport`)\n",
    "- At least 2 non-void instance methods that return calculated values (`getAverage`, `getLetterGrade`)\n",
    "- A main method that creates at least 2 Student instances and demonstrates all methods working independently\n",

    "- `int numAssignments` - count of assignments completed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Instance Methods:**\n",
    "- `addGrade(int points)` - void method that adds a grade and updates totals\n",
    "- `getAverage()` - returns the student's current average as a double\n",
    "- `getLetterGrade()` - returns a String letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on average\n",
    "- `printReport()` - void method that displays a formatted report of the student's performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading Scale:**\n",
    "- A: 90-100\n",
    "- B: 80-89\n",

    "\n",
    "| Criteria | Percent Weight | Description |\n",
    "|----------|---------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Functionality** | 40% | Program runs without errors, creates multiple Student objects, correctly adds grades, calculates averages, and assigns letter grades |\n",
    "| **Method Implementation** | 30% | Includes all required methods (addGrade, getAverage, getLetterGrade, printReport) that properly access/modify instance variables |\n",

    "| **Output & Presentation** | 10% | Clear, well-formatted output showing multiple students with different grades and formatted reports |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for Getting Started\n",
    "- Review the Counter example from the lesson notes—your Student class will work similarly\n",
    "- Start by creating the Student class with the three instance variables\n",
    "- Write your constructor to initialize the name and set totalPoints and numAssignments to 0\n",
    "- Implement `addGrade()` first—it should add to totalPoints and increment numAssignments\n",
    "- Test each method before moving to the next one\n",
    "- Remember: Test your hack multiple times and add updates in small increments in case you run into an error\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for Success\n",
    "1. **Start simple** - Get your constructor and `addGrade()` working first before tackling calculations\n",
    "2. **Watch for division** - When calculating average, make sure to cast to double: `(double)totalPoints / numAssignments`\n",
    "3. **Test with multiple students** - Create at least 2 Student objects with different grades to show independence\n",
    "4. **Comment your code** - Explain what each method does, especially your letter grade logic\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus Challenges (Optional for Extra Credit)\n",
    "Want to go above and beyond? Try adding:\n",
    "- A `getHighestGrade()` method that tracks and returns the best individual grade (you'll need to store individual grades, not just the total)\n",
    "- A `getLowestGrade()` method for the lowest individual grade\n",
    "- A `dropLowestGrade()` method that removes the lowest grade from calculations\n",
    "- A `compareTo(Student other)` method that compares two students' averages\n",
    "- Weighted grades—allow some assignments to be worth more points than others\n",
    "- A `reset()` method that clears all grades and starts fresh\n",
    "- Error checking to prevent negative grades or invalid input\n",
    "\n",
